legion world bosses?
these don't appear in /raidinfo, must be some other mechanic
might need to hardcode quest ids
GetNumSavedWorldBosses is for older expansions
possibly I can find the "active" quest and see if it's completed
  http://www.wowhead.com/quest=43192/terror-of-the-deep
  Type: Epic Elite World Quest
  /dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(GetCurrentMapAreaID())
    this does not show completed quests
SavedInstances now supports this apparently:

group raid finder wings by dungeon
blizz code does this by looking at the map name
