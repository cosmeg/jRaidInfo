legion world bosses?
these don't appear in /raidinfo, must be some other mechanic
might need to hardcode quest ids
GetNumSavedWorldBosses is for older expansions
possibly I can find the "active" quest and see if it's completed
  http://www.wowhead.com/quest=43192/terror-of-the-deep
  Type: Epic Elite World Quest
  /dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(GetCurrentMapAreaID())
    this does not show completed quests


group raid finder wings by dungeon
blizz code does this by looking at the map name

add daily heroic dungeon
with bonus role
look how this is done in the /lfd dialog
