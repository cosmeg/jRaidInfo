legion world bosses?
these don't appear in /raidinfo, must be some other mechanic
might need to hardcode quest ids
GetNumSavedWorldBosses is for older expansions
possibly I can find the "active" quest and see if it's completed

  Type: Epic Elite World Quest
  /dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(GetCurrentMapAreaID())
    this does not show completed quests


automatically discover instance ids
not sure I can discover the *size* though
