indicate *which* world boss is not killed
possibly I can find the "active" quest and see if it's completed
  http://www.wowhead.com/quest=43192/terror-of-the-deep
  Type: Epic Elite World Quest
    how can I find this?
/dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(GetCurrentMapAreaID())
  this does not show completed quests
/dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(1007)
  doesn't seem to work
/dump GetCurrentMapAreaID()
/dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(1014)
  this is dalaran
/dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(1015)
  azsuna - works
/run SetMapByID(1007)
/dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(1007, true)
  still nothing
/run foobar = GetCurrentMapAreaID()
/dump foobar
/dump C_TaskQuest.GetQuestsForPlayerByMapID(foobar)
WQL iterates over the zones

scan all world quests and see if any are up
  if I can just filter by type this would work too
